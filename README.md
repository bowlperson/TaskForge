# TaskForge
Taskforge - a gamified productivity app that turns your daily tasks, habits, and goals into a role-playing game where you earn rewards and level up by completing them.

## Features

- Create quests with difficulty presets and time multipliers to determine XP, plus main stat and optional skill tags.
- Delete, edit, or complete quests to gain XP; main stats earn 1 point per 300 XP and skills 1 point per 30 XP.
- Radar chart visualizes Main Stats; Skills page lets you add skills and tracks accumulated points without levels.
- Create and manage colored tags with edit/delete controls, select them on quests, and mark quests repeatable or as "Anti Quests" that subtract XP.
- Completed quests move to an Audit Log (pruned to 200 entries) where rewards, including gold, can be undone; a hard reset requires typing the player name to confirm.
- Player leveling uses 50 XP per level, resets every 100 levels with a prestige point, updates titles and portrait images, and grants random gold based on quest difficulty.
