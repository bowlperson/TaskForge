# TaskForge
Taskforge - a gamified productivity app that turns your daily tasks, habits, and goals into a role-playing game where you earn rewards and level up by completing them.

## Features

- Create quests with difficulty presets and time multipliers to determine XP, plus main stat and optional skill tags.
- Delete or complete quests to gain XP; main stats earn 1 point per 300 XP and skills 1 point per 30 XP.
- Radar chart visualizes Main Stats; Skills page tracks accumulated skill points without levels.
- Completed quests move to an Audit Log where rewards can be undone, and a hard reset requires typing the player name to confirm.
